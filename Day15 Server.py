# Day 15: Introduction to Networking
# - Topics:
# - Introduction to sockets and networking.
# - Understanding IP addresses, ports, and how to connect to a server.
# - Project:
# - Write a simple TCP client-server application using Pythonâ€™s socket module.

#     # Creating hostname and port number
#     host = socket.gethostname()
#     port = 9999
#
#     # Bind the socket to the host and port
#     server_socket.bind((host, port))
#
#     # Listen for incoming connections (max 5)
